### Lesson: Understanding and Manipulating Objects in JavaScript

#### Introduction to Objects

- **Definition**: In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity with properties and types.
- **Declaration**: Objects consist of a collection of key-value pairs.

```javascript
const car = {
    brand: 'Tesla',
    model: 'Model X',
    year: 2021
};
```

---

#### Accessing Properties

Retrieve values from an object using dot notation or bracket notation.

**Dot Notation**:

```javascript
console.log(car.brand);  // Output: Tesla
```

**Bracket Notation**:

```javascript
console.log(car['model']);  // Output: Model X
```

---

#### Adding and Modifying Properties

You can directly add or modify properties in an object.

```javascript
// Adding a property
car.color = 'Red';

// Modifying an existing property
car.year = 2022;
```

---

#### Deleting Properties

Use the `delete` operator to remove properties from an object.

```javascript
delete car.year;
```

---

#### Iterating Through Object Properties

Loop through all properties in an object.

```javascript
for(let key in car) {
    console.log(key, car[key]);
}
```

#### Practical Examples

1. **Storing Personal Information**:

    Represent a person's details using an object.

    ```javascript
    const person = {
        firstName: 'John',
        lastName: 'Doe',
        age: 30,
        address: {
            street: '123 Main St',
            city: 'Anytown',
            zip: '12345'
        }
    };
    ```

2. **Function within an Object (Method)**:

    Objects can also store functions.

    ```javascript
    const rectangle = {
        length: 10,
        breadth: 5,
        area: function() {
            return this.length * this.breadth;
        }
    };

    console.log(rectangle.area());  // Output: 50
    ```

3. **Nested Objects**:

    Objects can contain other objects. For instance, in the `person` object above, the `address` property is another object.

    Access nested properties:

    ```javascript
    console.log(person.address.city);  // Output: Anytown
    ```

4. **Array of Objects**:

    A common use case in real-world applications.

    ```javascript
    const students = [
        { name: 'Alice', grade: 90 },
        { name: 'Bob', grade: 85 },
        { name: 'Charlie', grade: 88 }
    ];

    // Print names of all students
    for(let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
        console.log(students[i].name);
    }
    ```

5. **Destructuring Objects**:

    Extracting specific properties from an object into individual variables.

    ```javascript
    const { firstName, age } = person;
    console.log(firstName, age);  // Output: John 30
    ```

#### Challenges for Practice

1. **Create a Book Object**:

    - Create an object that represents a book with properties for title, author, ISBN, and a `displayInfo` method that prints out the book's details.

2. **Vehicle Factory Function**:

    - Write a factory function that returns a vehicle object. The function should accept the brand, model, and year as arguments.

3. **Property Existence**:

    - Given an object, write a function that checks if a property exists in that object.

4. **Clone an Object**:

    - Write a function that returns a copy of an object.

Objects are the backbone of JavaScript, especially when dealing with real-world data. They allow us to create structured, modular, and readable code. Through the given examples and challenges, one can delve deep into understanding and mastering JavaScript objects.
