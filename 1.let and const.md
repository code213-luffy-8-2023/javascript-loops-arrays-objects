# `Let` & `Const` - Variables in JavaScript

## Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson we will be able to:

- Define variables using `let` and `const`

## Introduction

In JavaScript, we use variables to store data. We can then use the variable name to access the data. For example, we can store a number in a variable called `age` and then use `age` to access the number.

```javascript
let age = 30;
console.log(age); // 30
```

In this lesson, we will learn about two ways to define variables in JavaScript: `let` and `const`.

## `let`

The `let` keyword is used to define a variable that can be reassigned. For example, we can define a variable called `age` and assign it a value of `30`. We can then reassign `age` to a different value, such as `31`.

```javascript

let age = 30;
console.log(age); // 30

age = 31;
console.log(age); // 31
```

## `const`

The `const` keyword is used to define a variable that cannot be reassigned. For example, we can define a variable called `gender` and assign it a value of `female`. We cannot reassign `gender` to a different value. the variable cannot change after initialization.

```javascript

const gender = 'female';

gender = 'male' // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

## When to Use `let` and `const`

In general, we should use `const` by default. This is because we want to avoid accidentally reassigning a variable. If we need to reassign a variable, we can use `let`.

## Summary

in addition to the `var` keyword, we can use `let` and `const` to define variables in JavaScript. We should use `const` by default and only use `let` when we need to reassign a variable.
