1. **Count to 10**:
   - **Scenario**: Write a program that prints the numbers from 0 to 10.
   - **Hint**: Use a loop to print the numbers.
   - **Bonus**: Print the numbers in reverse order.

2. **Count to N**:
   - **Scenario**: Write a program that asks the user for a number and then prints the numbers from 0 to that number.
   - **Hint**: Use a loop to print the numbers.
   - **Bonus**: Print the numbers in reverse order.

3. **Count even numbers**:
   - **Scenario**: Write a program that prints the even numbers from 0 to 10.
   - **Hint**: Use a loop to print the numbers.
   - **Bonus**: Print the numbers in reverse order.

4. **Count odd numbers**:
   - **Scenario**: Write a program that prints the odd numbers from 0 to 10.
   - **Hint**: Use a loop to print the numbers.
   - **Bonus**: Print the numbers in reverse order.

5. **Counting Change**:
   - **Scenario**: You have a piggy bank full of coins. Write a program that asks the user how many of each coin they have (5DA, 10DA, 20DA, 50DA) and then calculates and displays the total amount of money they have in dollars.
   - **Hint**: Use a loop to go through each coin type. use `prompt` to ask the user for input.

6. **Multiplication Table**:
   - **Scenario**: Ask the user for a number and then display the multiplication table for that number up to 10.
   - **Hint**: Use a loop to iterate through numbers 1-10 and multiply them by the user's input.

7. **Guess the Number Game**:
   - **Scenario**: The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. The user has to guess the number. For each guess, the program provides feedback if the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
   - **Hint**: A `do...while` loop can be used until the user guesses correctly.

8. **Simple Quiz**:
   - **Scenario**: Create a quiz with 5 questions where the user can answer "true" or "false". Track the number of correct answers.
   - **Hint**: Use a loop to cycle through each question. Use `prompt` to ask the user for input.
   - **Question**: Paris is the capital of France? (true)
   - **Question**: The moon is made of cheese. (false)
   - **Question**: The sun is a star. (true)
   - **Question**: The earth is flat. (false)
   - **Question**: The earth is round. (true)
   - **Hint**: Use a loop to cycle through each question. Use `prompt` to ask the user for input.


## Solutions

1. **Count to 10**:

   ```javascript
   for(let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
       console.log(i);
   }
   ```

2. **Count to N**:

   ```javascript
    let n = prompt("Enter a number:");
    for(let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }
    ```

3. **Count even numbers**:
    ```javascript
    for(let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
        console.log(i);
    }
    ```

4. **Count odd numbers**:
    ```javascript
    for(let i = 1; i <= 10; i += 2) {
        console.log(i);
    }
    ```

5. **Counting Change**:
    ```javascript
    let total = 0;

    const coinTypes = ['5DA', '10DA', '20DA', '50DA'];
    const coinValues = [5, 10, 20, 50];

    for(let i = 0; i < coinTypes.length; i++) {
        let count = prompt(`How many ${coinTypes[i]} coins do you have?`);
        total += count * coinValues[i];
    }

    console.log(`You have ${total}DA`);
    ```

6. **Multiplication Table**:
    ```javascript
    let n = prompt("Enter a number:");
    for(let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        console.log(`${n} x ${i} = ${n * i}`);
    }
    ```

7. **Guess the Number Game**:
    ```javascript

    let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;

    let guess = 0;

    do {
        guess = prompt("Guess a number between 1 and 100:");
        if(guess > randomNumber) {
            console.log("Too high!");
        } else if(guess < randomNumber) {
            console.log("Too low!");
        }
    } while(guess != randomNumber);

    console.log("You guessed correctly!");
    ```

8. **Simple Quiz**:
    ```javascript

    let questions = [
        "Paris is the capital of France?",
        "The moon is made of cheese.",
        "The sun is a star.",
        "The earth is flat.",
        "The earth is round."
    ];

    let answers = [
        "true",
        "false",
        "true",
        "false",
        "true"
    ];

    let correctAnswers = 0;

    for(let i = 0; i < questions.length; i++) {
        let answer = prompt(questions[i]);
        if(answer.toLowerCase() === answers[i]) {
            correctAnswers++;
        }
    }

    console.log(`You got ${correctAnswers} correct answers!`);
    ```
